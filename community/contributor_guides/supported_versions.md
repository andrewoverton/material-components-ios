# Supported versions

The purpose of this document is to clearly communicate which versions of specific technologes the
core team uses to build Material components.

## Xcode

The core team uses **Xcode 7.2.1** and supports compilation of both Swift and Objective-C code to
the corresponding language versions.

New Swift language features will be introduced in examples only once the team moves to a new version
of Xcode.

## iOS

All components are expected to support **iOS 7.0 and above**.
