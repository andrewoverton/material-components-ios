# Community

Material Components for iOS is intended to be a full open source project that accepts contributions from community members. We can work together to optimize Material Design on iOS.

## Community Guidelines
### Community Structure
Core team is the small group of engineers from Google, Inc. responsible for the strategic direction and the appointment of technical leaders from the community. The Core team will also decide if submissions are in line with the Material Design spec.
Committer is anyone that has commit access to the code base.
Contributor is anyone that contributes a patch or helps with code reviews.

### Core team
- Alastair Tse - Tech Lead - [altse@google.com] (mailto:altse@google.com) 
- Adrian Secord - Tech Lead - [ajsecord@google.com] (mailto:ajsecord@google.com)
- Katy Kasmai - Engineering Program Manager - [katykasmai@google.com] (mailto:katykasmai@google.com)
- Chris Cox - UX Engineer - [cjcox@google.com] (mailto:cjcox@google.com)

### Code of Conduct
As contributors and maintainers of the project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes through posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments and any other related activities.

Communication through any of our Material Design channels ([GitHub](http://github.com/google/material-components-ios), StackOverflow, [Google+](http://plus.google.com/+googledesign), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/googledesign), etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender and expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, age, race, ethnicity, religion, nationality or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the project to do the same. We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, community members commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of participating in this project. Community members who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the project may take action, removing issues, comments, and pull requests or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us at material-components-ios-discuss@googlegroups.com.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Questions?
If you have questions about how to use Material Components iOS, please direct these to

1. Our [Google Group mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/material-components-ios-discuss),
2. The [materialcomponentsios tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/materialcomponentsios), or
3. Our [Slack discussion channel](http://googleoss.slack.com).

### Found an Issue?
If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/issues) to our GitHub repository. Even better: submit a fix as a pull request!

### Feature Request?
You can request a new feature by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/issues) to our GitHub repository. If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:
- Major changes that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on our [dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/material-components-ios-discuss) so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- Small Changes can be crafted and submitted to the GitHub Repository as a Pull Request.

## Contributing
### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue [search the archive](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/issues), maybe your question was already answered.
If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

- Overview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
- Motivation for or Use Case - explain why this is a bug for you
- Version(s) - is it a regression?
- Browsers and Operating System - is this a problem with all browsers or only IE8?
- Reproduce the Error - was it just a one time error or can you show the steps to reproduce?
- Related Issues - has a similar issue been reported before?
- Suggest a Fix - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)

Here is a great example of a well defined issue: [https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5069](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5069)

### Submitting a Pull Request
For major changes, it's worthwhile discussing the idea on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/material-components-ios-discuss)—that way you'll get early feedback on your idea and find out if the approach has been tried before or if someone else is working on it. [Search our GitHub](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/issues) issues to see if anyone has proposed the idea before, too. Feature requests and bug fixes should be tracked with issues, so file one early on and assign it to yourself.

Once you have code that is ready to share, please create a pull request against our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios). See [GitHub's documentation about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for more information.

Pull requests will be reviewed in [Phabricator's Differential code review tool](http://codereview.cc) instead of directly in GitHub. When you submit your pull request, a bot will reply with a link to the code review discussion. If you haven't done so before, create a new account on Phabricator and join the discussion of your changes.

### Coding Style
Material Components uses the [Google style guide for Objective-C code](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.xml)—the code in your pull requests should follow the style guide. To save time in review, you can use [clang-format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to automatically format your code before making the pull request.
